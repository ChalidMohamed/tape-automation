## üéõÔ∏è Automated Tape Import & Reporting with Veeam


Hi everyone,

In one of my recent customer projects, I faced the challenge of migrating a client from **IBM TSM** to **Veeam**. 
One major concern was the **tape handling and reporting** capabilities ‚Äì the customer was used to a different level of automation with TSM and found Veeam‚Äôs native features lacking in comparison.

### üîç Requirements:
- **Daily backups to tape**, followed by offsite rotation. 
- An **automated report** showing: (archieved via  **[MyVeeamReport](https://github.com/marcohorstmann/MyVeeamReport)**) 
  - Which tapes need to be taken offsite.
  - Which tapes should be brought back from the safe.
- **Automatic re-import** of tapes whose write protection had expired.


This allowed the customer to receive a daily automated overview of all relevant tape activities.

About this script
To automate the re-import of tapes, we developed a custom **PowerShell script** that:
- Scans all tapes in the tape library.
- Identifies tapes whose write protection has expired.
- Moves them back into the **Free Pool** for reuse.
- Runs daily as a **Scheduled Task**.
- Sends an **email summary** with the number of tapes imported.
- Moves them back into the **Free Pool** for reuse.
- Can be ru daily as a **Scheduled Task**.
- Sends an **email summary** with the number of tapes imported.
